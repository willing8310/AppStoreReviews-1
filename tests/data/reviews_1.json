Simple, efficace et gratuite!!! Quoi de mieux? Si vous utilisez beaucoup les services Google (Gmail, Agenda, etc...), vous allez adorer c'est certain. Ne perdez pas votre temps comme moi à en essayer plusieurs qui ne valent pas la peine, celle-là c'est la meilleure!"

I left a review for what appears to be an old version now, and the app changed so much I didn't even recognize it. Very functional, clean and thought out UI; great features. Love that it syncs with Google tasks. All this functionality and improvement surely deserves a much prettier icon :).\n\nThanks for the hard work, and спасибо что нет рекламы, пока что, во всяком случае :)"
